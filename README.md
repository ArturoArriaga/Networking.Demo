# Networking.Arriaga.Demo

This demo application fetches data from the iTunes API and organizes it inside of the brand new Compositional Layout for UICollectionViewController that was release in iOS 13. As a bonus, I've decided to fead the data into the controller using the (also brand new) diffable data source introduced at WWDC 19.

## Techniques implemented:
* Compositional Layout
* UICollectionViewController
* DiffableData Source
* Singleton design pattern for Service networking layer
* URLSession class API for downloading data from indicated URLs
* Support for dark mode
