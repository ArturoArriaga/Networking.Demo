# Networking.Arriaga.Demo

This demo application fetches data from the iTunes API and organizes it inside of the brand new Compositional Layout for UICollectionViewController that was release in iOS 13. As a bonus, I've decided to oganize the data using the (also brand new) diffable data source that was also release as part of iOS 13 and previewed at WWDC 19.

## Techniques implemented:
* Compositional Layout
